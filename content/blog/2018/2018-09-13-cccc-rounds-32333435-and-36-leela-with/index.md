First round CCCC approaches to its end and situation is clear by now.  
Houdini, Komodo and Stockfish will be in top 3 advancing to stage 2, with
Stockfish and Komodo to fight for the 1st place in this 1st stage, thatdoesn't
mean much anyway, Fire and Leela would most probably advance to the next round
also with some minor chances of not achieving it, and Shredder, Booot,
Ethereal and Andscacs will fight for the other 3 places for stage 2.

Leela had 5 draws in these 5 rounds with 2 easy and 3 very hard opponents and
she has 7 consecutive draws.

Simulations using Bayeselo give right now(after and the Andscacs-Inavhoe 1-0
game of round 37):  
Probability to promote:  
Stockfish 100 %  
Komodo 100 %  
Houdini 100 %  
Fire 100 %  
 **Lc0** 99.67 %  
Shredder 90.33 %  
Booot 81.67 %  
Andscacs 77.67 %  
Ethereal 44.67 %

 **ROUND 32**  
Leela had an extra-disastrous opening with Senpai and never managed to recover
so it ended in a draw. Against the very weak in this CCCC Senpai, Leela had to
win but the selection of the opening moves was a nightmare and even with
Senpai playing sub optimal moves, Leela never really managed to get an
advantage so it was easy draw.

**ROUND 33**  
Leela against another very weak in this CCCC engine, didn't manage to win
again, because her opening treatment was not perfect, against going for a very
open center that does not suit her. She took a small advantage but it was not
enough.  
Stockfish won against Houdini in this round so Houdini now has 2 losses.

Ethereal lost to Arasan with white and that was a big surprise but the way it
lost is very odd and must be due to hardware problems. Ethereal played
**59.Nxd5??** an incredible blunder that only considers at depth 1. Afterwards
examination of the logs showed it has spent 6 seconds at depth a that is a
factor of 1000 more than what normally does so there had to be a problem with
Ethereal's usage of hardware. CCCC should probably examine if they have to
replay the game preferably from the position before Nxd5.

ROUND 34  
Leela at last, had this time a normal opening and tried against Andscacs to
gain some decisive advantage but Andscacs played very well and some times it's
not easy to win.  
Ethereal drew Wasp and Shredder didn't manage to win against Gull with white
so they lost some ground for the top 8 battle, since Booot won against Arasan
with black.

**ROUND 35**  
Leela with white pieces faced the CCCC till that time leader Komodo and after
a rather dubious opening choice she quickly managed to gain a small advantage.
This advantage grew stronger as she was constantly outplaying Komodo and soon
they reached a won position for Leela. Leela didn't choose the best moves to
end this quickly but still maintained the winning advantage. They got to an
endgame that should be won for white and they finally reached a position that
endgame tablebases show it's winning for white. Komodo showed it on its PV
also but Leela didn't manage to find the winning moves. She had 4 chances to
win in this endgame and along with the other 2 chances to win easily in late
middlegame earlier, she lost 6 times the move to offer the finishing blow.  
She(the test 10 nets generally, as also one of them 11089 that is being used
in CCCC) obviously lacks specific endgame knowledge for some endings
especially with opposite color Bishops endings but a new test 20 is being run
and hopefully will provide better endgame, even though other training methods
for endgames are examined also.

Boot won again and since Ethereal and Andscacs drew and Shredder lost to
Fizbo(!), its 2nd loss in CCCC, it got a step closer to next stage.

She needs improvement in this and she will probably improve. Endgame
tablebases that supports them but no uses them in CCCC is an obvious way that
she improves but this is not the whole story since tablebases does not solve
the whole problem. More training will surely help and better training
procedures are to be examined that will fix these problems, since it's a pity
to outplay opponents and not take what she deserved because of not being able
to convert. A sure thing is that Leela with all these issues still is a top

**ROUND 36**  
Another round with a very tough opponent for Leela, one of the biggest tests
for her as she faced with black Houdini. Yet, she very easily with some
paradoxical middlegame play, seemingly not paying that much attention to the
strong white forces that gathered in the Kingside and could threaten  
the black King, it managed not only to equalize but to achieve and a minor
edge! It was not enough though with the solid play by Houdin.

Shredder had a draw with Ethereal, Boot with Texel and Andscacs lost to Komodo
so the battle for top 8 continues in a dramatic fashion since many critical
games, like Booot-Shredder of next round are coming.

has now managed not to lose none of the 6 games with the big 3 engines as she
drew both with black and white rather very comfortably(and she could have won
her white game with Komodo actually) Stockfish, Komodo and Houdini.} 1/2-1/2

list the real result should be counted, as the CCCC result by their rules
because Gull crashed, was 1-0 in favor of Lc0.
