Can be downloaded
[here](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/releases/tag/v0.17.0).

<!--more-->

It has no changes relative to RC2. For the list of differences relative to
v0.16, see posts for
[v0.17.0-rc1]({{< ref "2018-08-19-lc0-v0170-rc1-has-been-released" >}}) and
[v0.17.0-rc2]({{< ref "2018-08-21-lc0-v0170-rc2-has-been-released" >}}).

It is encouraged now that everyone who contributes training games, switches to
version v0.17.0.

After the [network training reset]({{< ref "2018-08-23-test10-learning-rate-has-been-lowered" >}}) (which is probably few weeks from now), only version v0.17 will
be accepted. This is because v0.16 has [rule50 encoding bug]({{< ref "2018-08-20-rule50-encoding-bug-is-found" >}}).
