**Stage 2** of CCCC has already started before 2 days. Not without problems
initially with repeating restarts but at last now it's running flawlessly.  
 **Stockfish** continues to be invincible! As it hasn't lost a single game in
the first 46 games of stage 1 plus the 15th till now in stage 2.  
While the so far unbeatable too Komodo, in this stage lost to Houdini.

 **Leela** on the other hand had after 6 games with the big 3, 6 draws as in
stage 1. So now she is the only engine that has not lost a game from the big
3. She is going fine also generally till now since she won 4 games also and
shares 3rd place with Komodo. She lost 1 game though due to a huge blunder
with a blind spot of her in an equal position.

Every engine will play 10 times all the other so 70 games for each engine will
be played in this stage.  
Top 2 will promote to the super final.

Below are the results, the games of Leela with some comments as also the
standings and ratings.

1, where engines played all moves and opening by themselves, he in stage 2,
first 4 plies(2 moves) are predefined. And as it seems in every game there is
and a different position. This is bad of course since it introduces a certain
kind of unfairness as one engine might be unlucky and get worse openings, etc.
They say that over the course of 70 games per engine this cancels out, but
this is just an assumption and reality is that this imbalance and no symmetry,
by definition creates not equal conditions. Not that major issue though and it
creates more interesting games anyway with so much variety.} 3. cxd5 {Now,

stay in the middle but this is no concern at all without Queens on the board.

so probably white is better here.} 10. Bd2 Be6 11. e3 O-O-O 12. Bc3 f6 13. Nd2

was forced(4 first plies arepredefined for engines to play) and a good battle
in opening and early middlegame Stockfish came with 2 Knights versus the
bishop pair of Leela but with a better position so Stockfish was better. After
many maneuvers some well defined immovable Pawn chains were created with a
very close position. Stockfish managed to successfully open some lines and
trade the Bishop pair achieving a seemingly deadly pin on Rook with a free
Pawn to move. It even showed +1.89 scores for it with with millions of endgame
tablebase hits. But as it seems the position was dead draw all the way. Leela
has built a fortress where white couldn't do anything! White even managed to
grab a Pawn but it was pointless and draw was inevitable.} c5 2. c3 e5 3. Bc4

opening that arrived, she created an imbalance having a Bishop for a Rook and
a Pawn of Boot! Normally this is too much and in the position she had nothing
was immediatelly forcing she didn't even have space advantage. But with very
clever play managed to make a suffocating position for Booot where Booot
finally had to give its Queen for 2 Rooks and with initiative to Leela so it
was tough to hold. Instructive play by Leela after the exchange sacrifice.} d5

{In a little odd opening, black got 1 Pawn more and a-b Passed Pawns but of
course white would be too dangerous with its centralized forces. Leela played
wisely prefering not to keep the 1 Pawn advantage so she gave it to destroy
Komodo's plans for initiative with an attack and game very quickly reached a a
dynamic but easily by these engines manageable position. With this draw, Leela
has faced 6 times the big 3 engines, Stockfish, Houdini and Komodo, in stage 2
and other 6 in stage 1, for a total of 12 games. All games were draws so she
proves she is not easy to crack.} g6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 d5 5. cxd5
