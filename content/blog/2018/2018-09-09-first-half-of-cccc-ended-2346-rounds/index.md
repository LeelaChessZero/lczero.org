First half of the CCCC tournament has ended.  
It's a 46 rounds tournament and so 23 rounds have been played. Time control is
15'+5" and engines will play all against all twice, one with black and one
with white, while pondering is on and no opening books are used and 6 pieces
tablebases are being used.  
Top 8 engines promote to next round.

Till now there are 4 distinctive groups that have been formed. The top 3 that
are consisted of the known "big 3" of computer Chess this moment and for the
last 4-5 years, Stockfish, Komodo and Houdini, the other group the engines
that fight for the top 8, Leela, Shredder are the leaders of this group that
show they might have the advantage and the other Fire, Booot, Ethereal and
Andscacs.  
There is a group 8-9 engines that seems to just be in the middle without
having any prospects of going to top 8 and there is the low end of the
tournament that does not do that good.  
There are 4 engines that till now haven't lost any game so far. Stockfish,
Houdini, Komodo and Leela.

****This is with Lc0 - Gull game counted as draw.** Since this is a rating
list the real result should be counted, as the CCCC result by their rules
because Gull crashed, was 1-0 in favor of Lc0.

•Houdini has an exceptional tournament thus far, winning against almost every
engine below top 8. In this short time control Houdini is to be expected to
continue doing great.  
•Komodo is very solid also and the only engine that has won against an engine
of the top 5 with its win against Shredder. Komodo played some wonderful
games. This short time control doesn't fit perfectly to Komodo, but Komodo is
super strong at every time control of course.  
•Stockfish as expected is very high in the ranking but being the strongest
engine in the world this time and being 2nd can be considered underperformance
but of course too small sample size with just 23 games to draw any
conclusions. Stockfish just plays unbelievably solid with just a bit waiting
of its opponents to play even the smallest inaccuracies that is expert in
taking advantage of them.  
• **Leela** being 4th and undefeated is a nice performance so far for an
engine that was born before 6 months. It has shown in many games a different
approach from traditional games and understanding of positions. It has played
some very spectacular games. She has played also some of the most bizarre
games. She still suffers a bit from not creating complications against weaker
opponents so she draws a lot against weaker opponents.  
•Shredder started perfectly but its performance has fallen a bit. Still plays
aggressively but also very solid. Had just one defeat so far from Komodo.  
•Fire is very solid as expected, very good at tactics and doing exceptionally
against weaker engines. It has 3 losses though from the top 5.  
•Booot is having a surprisingly good tournament so far and this is because it
is killing the low end engines! It has a lot of draws though with middle group
of engines but lost only 2 times from the top 5.  
•Ethereal started badly, very badly but as expected it climbed to top 8 and
will probably stay there. IT seems unstable though and while it has some good
moments where it shows its true potential, it has some moments where it plays
dubiously.  
•Andscacs is also killing the weakest engines but has many problems against
the first 11 having lost already 5 times. It's expected to be on top 8
replacing Booot, but perhaps Booot is going to hold.

•Fritz is solid enough but is not having enough wins against weaker engines to
fight for top 8. Probably will be 9-10 not having a chance to try for top 8.  
•Xiphos is relatively solid having 13 draws so far but it's strength is not
for top 8.  
•Vajolet is doing ok for the lowest 12 of the tournament but is losing a lot
when facing the highest 12. Even though she drew against Houdini.  
•Pedone plays some clever Chess, has 14 draws so far but suffers a lot against
the top 10 engines.  
•Texel plays an active Chess and is relativelly good at tactics but stands no
chance for the top 8 where it lost most of the games aganist them.  
•Gull is not winning enough even though it is rather solid and its place is
expected.  
•Fizbo is underperforming here so far with all these draws. It has 1 win 5
losses and **17 draws**! It is a better engines than this.

•Arasan is having a logical performance of its strength so far. It got also
some nice results like the 2 draws against Stockfish and Komodo.  
•Laser is severely underperforming here. This is very strange so far.  
•Nemorino is playing some risky Chess but this does not mean it's for its own
good. Its place is to be expected.  
•Wasp seems very solid most of the times early simplificating the position in
many games. It got 3 draws against Houdini, Leela and Shredder.  
•Ivanhoe seems very unstable and dubious playing many times to be able to be
higher in the ranking.  
•Senpai is one of the weakest engines of the tournament so it is to be
expected this low place.  
•Crafty, the good old Crafty is trying to compete with the new generation but
obviously it is too much for it. It is getting outplayed in most games. Took a
draw from Leela though (even in a lost position where Leela didn't manage to
find the win).  
•Nirvana for some reason is severely underperforming. It plays very weak Chess
and this is strange since it's usually much stronger than this.

45% of the games are draws. A rather good result of decided games.  
A whole lot of games have French defense! Engines for some reason prefer
1...e6 over "normal" 1...e5 after 1.e4.
