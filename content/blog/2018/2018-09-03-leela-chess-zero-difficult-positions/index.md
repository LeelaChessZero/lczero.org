Traditional Chess engines with classic Alpha-Beta search, sometimes have huge
problems with some positions that require deep planning and understanding of
the position. This is because they try to search all possible moves in a
position and then their replies and then all the replies of the replies, etc.
They discard most moves of course with clever algorithms that prune almost all
moves but a few that they focus on. With a cost of course to discard a move,
not good looking at first sight, but that after many moves ahead it proves to
be a very good one. Traditional engines also have a handcrafted evaluation
function. That means in order to judge a position they have to rely on human
rules for it, e.g bonus for Rook on open file, bonus if a Pawn is on 6th rank
etc, etc.

<!--more-->

Neural net engines with latest advances Deepmind brought with deep learning
techniques used to train convolutional neutral networks, like Leela, on the
other hand use a much more powerful evaluation function. One that acquired
Chess knowledge about every single aspect of Chess by playing against itself
millions of games. No need to manually put hundreds instructions like "if it's
a closed position then Knight value increases and Rook's decreases" etc. You
let them play against itself and they create by themselves millions of such
"rules". Leela also uses a MCTS(Monte Carlo Tree Search) type of search that
is completely different than traditional AlphaBeta search.

So it's no wonder that Leela plays very frequently now, moves that other top
engines like Stockfish, Komodo, Houdini etc, can't find.  
In some cases like these that would be shown here, it even plays moves that
not a single one traditional engine can find, or that they need very long
searching to do!  
Of course that doesn't mean Leela finds most deep testpositions because this
is not true. Leela is still not that good anyway in testpositions that require
tactics. But when long strategical thinking is required without so much
immediate tactics, then Leela usually shines!

 _ **Test position 1.**_

White to play.

![]({{< file "popki7671.png" >}})

White has created a nice concentration of its pieces in the Kingside but has
many problems to solve, especially with Bxa3 pending that will destroy white's
position. Defensive resources of black are big and King's position seems very
solid. The c2 Knight is very annoying too for white. Most traditional engines
give here black slightly better or even a lot better or even winning!  
And want to play moves like Rh6, Bf2, Nd2. Moves that lead nowhere for white
and probably are losing.

But if you let Leela analyze the position(since Leela Chess Zero is just the
project name, by saying LCZero, we're referring to the body of her the **Lc0
binary** that takes the neural net and provides the search, plus the brain of
her, and that is the **nets/weights** , and here i tried about 9 nets and all
find the same move) you will see her after only something less than 1 second
of thought proposing **Qf6+** sacrificing the Queen with a big plus score for
white!!  
And not only this but she is finding the correct continuation of **Ng5** later
on that white has to play! h5 Bxh5 that she is playing are the correct move
for black also(the toughest defense) and the best reply by white.

Note that the analysis of this position and for all positions by Leela should
be done by **not providing the simple FEN or EPD** and let it analyze, but by
providing a history of moves that ended in that position. And this is because
of the way Leela thinks, she thinks of position sequences from the start of
the game. But practically it is proven that you do not need to provide Leela
with a full history from starting position to the desired one, but only 2-3
moves. By making her analyze from a FEN, you are IN A HUGE DANGER of obtaining
an analysis that is completely meaningless.  
So for example to obtain the above analysis for the position, we gave her the
**PGN** :

[Event "?"]  
[Site "?"]  
[Date "????.??.??"]  
[Round "?"]  
[White "New game"]  
[Black "?"]  
[Result "*"]

[PlyCount "2"]

1\. Qf4 Nc2 *

And this is the correct move in this position, white to give its Queen! And it
wins the game!

countless variations with many difficult key moves for white to find.} 1-0

_**Test position 2.**_

White to play.

![]({{< file "hkjhkj72.png" >}})

This is a position that results in one of the variations of the previous
position 1. White is a Queen down. Yet it is winning and has a forced
checkmate with **Rg1!!**.  
Stockfish the best engine as of now, make about 1.6 billion nodes in order to
find the winning move. Most other traditional engines have also big problems
finding this as they require to calculate many many nodes.

Leela again finds it immediately with a winning score!

 _ **Test position 3.**_

White to play.

![]({{< file "hkjhkj89793.png" >}})

Here we have a classic anticomputer position where traditional engines have
many problems to see that the only way for white to win is by playing
**Qxb5!**  
A human can see it easily. Engines have huge problems in this and want to save
their Queen by retreating.  
But not Leela, as it plays Qxb5 instantly!

 _ **Test position 4.**_

Black to play.

![]({{< file "ggj6876874.png" >}})

Here is a position from a real game where Leela as black has played **g5!!** A
very deep positional move, trying to trap the Bishop.  
Most engines don't seem to find it in logical time.

_**Test position 5.**_

White to play.

![]({{< file "hkhkj79879795.png" >}})

In this again anticomputer position white has to immediately play **Bxb5!!**
in order to win.  
Most engines need a very long search in order to find it if at all since many
are stuck in capturing the Knight that only draws after Rxe2! by black.  
Not Leela, since after just some seconds finds Bxb5 with a winning score.

Yet, in the most difficult types of positions for computers in Chess, the
fortress positions, Leela doesn't fare well at all generally despite the fact
that in the aforementioned 2 positions it did perfectly. But generally
especially in draw fortress situations she does not have too much success.
Which is strange for a MCTS type search since one would expect an engine with
random rollouts like Monte Carlo does, to be able to see through its
statistics that one move in a fortress position holds for example the draw.
But this does not occur here since Leela does not do random rollouts but uses
the neural net to guide the search.  
So in order to be able to solve fortress positions also, she just need more
training games.
