v0.19.0 is finally out of "release candidate" status, and now is fully
released!  
It has been quite a long bugfixing run with 5 release candidates, but now all
known issues seem to be resolved.

Can be downloaded
[here](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/releases/tag/v0.19.0).

For the list of differences relative to v0.18, see post for
[v0.19.0-rc1](../../../2018/11/lc0-v0190-rc1-has-been-
released.html).

For people contributing training games, there's no need to rush to upgrade,
it's fine to use v0.18.
