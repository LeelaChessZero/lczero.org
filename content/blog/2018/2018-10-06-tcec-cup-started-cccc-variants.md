The **TCEC Cup** has started and 2 match pairs will be played every day.  
We remind that 32 engines will compete in a Knockout elimination tournament,
and in each pair match, the best out of 8 games will promote to next round.  
That means if an engine completes first, in the 8 games, 4.5 points will
promote. As per their decision if an engine completes first **4.5 or 5
points** , the match is stopped and the engine promotes to next round. So not
all 8 games will be played if not necessary.  
Also the tournament would not necessarily be continuous like normal TCEC,
since only **_2 pairs_ will be played _every day_ **even if there is time for
more. The games will begin **_12:30 UTC_ every day.**  
  
Till now **Stockfish** crushed Ivanhoe with a 5-0 score and promoted and
**Gull** won 4.5-2.5 against Texel and will play Stockfish in next round.  
  
According to the above, today there will be the Fizbo- Hannibal and Chiron-
Nemorino matches, on Sunday Fire-Senpai and Vajolet-Booot and **Leela will
play on Monday against Laser** as also Ethereal against Rodent.

_Meanwhile in **Chess.com** the **variants games** are being played right
now._  
  
In the **f2-Pawn missing Chess variant** Leela did fine and actually got
first, because of having higher SB tiebreaker score, since she won Stockfish
with black and [with white](http://blog.lczero.org/2018/10/leela-wins-match-
series-against-komodo.html). Interestingly out of the 30 games that have been
played in this Pawn odds Chess, there was **only 1 win with white pieces** ,
the **Leela-Stockfish** one, 15 with black pieces and 14 draws.  
  
In the **3 Queens variant** as it was expected, Leela did terribly, since not
having seen before this position in her training and having seen probably very
few positions with 3 Queens each side in her training, Leela could not play
this variant at all.  
Houdini also did terribly here, since it was crashing in every game since it
doesn't support obvious illegal Chess positions because of material(since
generally Houdini supports not valid Chess positions like this FEN
_1r5b/3nk1pp/1p6/8/2P5/3B1P2/P4KP1/2R3R1 w - - 0 1_ but does not support Chess
positions with not valid material since in this variant each side has 3 Queens
and 8 Pawns so the Queens couldn't come from promoted Pawns so this is an
illegal Chess position and Houdini must have a counter to count such things,
like this one).  
  
In the **Knightmare** Leela did also terribly since again she hasn't seen this
position in her training and she couldn't have seen this as like the 3 Queens
variant, Knightmare's starting position also is **not a valid Chess position**
so you can't expect Leela to play it. Houdini also crashed again in every game
as it doesn't support such obviously not valid Chess positions.  
  
In the **One row up Chess variant** , that is almost complete Leela had 8
draws and one loss so far.  
  
  
Here are the standings in each variant:
