**Leela** won **16-14** against **Komodo** the 30 games match to determine 3rd
position in CCCC1, while on the variants tournament she **won a game against
Stockfish** while being **handicapped having a Pawn less!!**

So the **3rd place** **Komodo-Leela** match has ended with Leela winning
16-14, having **5 wins, 3 losses and 22 draws** , so Leela had finished 3rd in
the first CCCC tournament according to Chess.com changed rules.

One thing remains to be seen though if they will remove **game 3** of this
match where from a mistake/bug the same opening with before was repeated while
it shouldn't.  
They had to use 15 predefined opening positions(for 3 first moves) with
reversed colors, so each engine will have to play every position once with
black and once with white.

So this normally happened in the first 2 games where Leela won both 2 games(as
white and as black) with a specific opening(Torre Attack). Then while King's
Gambit opening should have been used in the 3rd game (Komodo had white), the
previous Torre opening was used again. Komodo deviated early in move 10 so a
completely different game has been played. Leela won again.  
Thing is the final score is 16-14 and if we don't count the 3rd game it would
be 15-14, so Komodo would have a chance to tie the series with the Komodo-
Leela game on King's Gambit opening. Even though in that variation of King's
Gambit, engines favor black and usually engine games end with a draw or a
black win but this has to be seen for the current pair.

PGN](https://georgemj23.000webhostapp.com/KomodoLeela-30-Bonus-games.pgn)

Meanwhile the Chess variants games have started.  
First is the f2-Pawn missing variant where Leela already lost easily the games
as white against Komodo and Ethereal, drew with black against Houdini and made
a **shocker win with white, against Stockfish!**  
Yes **Leela being handicapped playing with white with a missing f2-Pawn** ,
went on to win against **Stockfish** after slowly outplaying it to reach a won
endgame. Stockfish made a mistake in a tough position very early but this was
not the critical mistake since after that the position was equal anyway.
Somehow without any apparent big mistake of black(Stockfish), black's position
got worse and worse and the endgame they reached was won for white, where
Leela after her usual shuffling instead of immediate killing, managed to win.

It was also the first win with white pieces of any engine till now in this
variant, after 9 black wins and 4 draws!!  
For more info about it [READ HERE](../../../2018/09/cccc-leela-

white) and we had 6 black wins and 3 draws. So Leela is the first engine that

Testing about the aforementioned, in the above blog post, disparity in
results/behavior of Leela between a FEN position and a PGN position(with
history of moves that lead to the desired position), the following 2 gaunlets
had Leela with Lc0v18 11089 +3-6 TBs versus: _Stockfish dev, Stockfish 8,
Fizbo 2, Ethereal 11, Andscacs 0.94, Booot 6.3.1 and Fire 7.1_ from the **"Up
one row"** position variant that they will play in the variants tournament.  
Time control was 4'+2" and the Stockfish/Leela nodes per second ratio of
**850** , the same Deepmind used for AlphaZero-Stockfish 8 games(while in CCCC
they have **2000** , which, compared to 850, is more in favor for traditional
engines obviously).

The "up one row" position:

The one gaunlet is with FEN of the variant:  
rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR/8 w kq - 0 1

The other gaunlet is with PGN of the variant:

So in this particular variant, Leela doesn't seem to be affected much by the
FEN issue she has. She even got a point more with FEN!
