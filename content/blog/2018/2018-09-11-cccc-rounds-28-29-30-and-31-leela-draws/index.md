It seems Leela is hiding something that is beyond us. How else can be
explained that after Fizbo a 3325 CCRL Elo engine with endgame tablebases in a
dead 4-men position lost to Leela, now Leela in another dead draw position
made Xiphos, a 3200 CCRL Elo engines, to lose!  
At round 29 there was the first loss in this tournament of one of the big 3,
as Houdini with black lost to Ethereal!

 **ROUND 28**  
Andscacs lost to Stockfish and lost ground for the battle of 8th place but
Ethereal and Booot lost to Komodo and Leela respectively so they did not took
advantage of it so things remained the same.  
Fire won against Ivanhoe so now it has a comfortable place inside top 8.

Leela playing with Booot a French defense(what else?) opening, she took a very
easy win by playing simple Chess. She initially pushed all her Pawns,
h4,f4,g4, in from of the castled King gaining all the space in Kingside and
first thoughts were that she is planning an attack. But suddenly she forced
the  
exchange of Queens getting a huge Knight on d6 and from then on some almost
forced trades have been made going to an endgame that as it seems it was
almost lost for black since its King was too far away and white had a 3-2 Pawn
majority on Queenside.

**ROUND 29**  
Andscacs had a draw with Shredder and Stockfish won so after Komodo drew with
Booot and Houdini lost, now Stockfish goes to the natural position of it, to
the top!  
So Houdini with black lost to Ethereal in a very interesting game, another
French defense that had Houdini giving its Rook for a Knight for keeping
white's King in the center. It was a clever idea and Ethereal had to defend
well after that, to secure his King. And Ethereal did defend excellently
forcing the exchange of the Queens so his King felt more safe. After that
Ethereal had a double Rooks + double Bishops + 3 Pawns against Rook + 2
Knights + Bishop + 5 Pawns of black. An interesting imbalance that Ethereal
won masterfully because of the power of the double Rooks.  
A very nice game to watch. So now only Komodo and Stockfish remain undefeated.

Leela with black against Xiphos was another crazy circus game because of how
it ended. In a surprisingly peaceful Sicilian with 4.Qxd4, many exchanges
happened early and by move 25 it was already seemed draw was unavoidable.
Queens got exchanged too, with Xiphos preferring to give a Rook for a Bishop
and a Pawn. A very safe move though, since the position was uncrackable by
black and a dead draw.  
Engines shuffled pointlessly and 50 move rule with a draw was approaching. But
5 moves before 50 move rule would declare as draw the game, Xiphos made a huge
blunder giving a check that allowed the black King to invade into white's
position. Actually white would still hold the black King away, had not been a
Rook move that caused a zugzwang situation that allowed its King to penetrate.
Leela after the mistake won on the spot. It's really inexplicable how Xiphos
fell to that mistake. Was this a graph history interaction(GHI) issue? Was
this a bug in Xiphos with 50 move rule or zugzwang detection? Its author will
have to find out, even though with multithreading search reproducibility is
never easy.

**ROUND 30**  
Andscacs got closer to top 8 since it won against Senpai while Ethereal had a
draw with Fritz and Booot lost from Houdini.

Leela didn't have a good game since after opening it ended up in a position
where she didn't have a clear target and didn't managed to find a plan to
create a specific target. In an almost equal position she has fallen again for
a perpetual check tactic, a rather deep one this time, and 3 fold repetition
draw occurred. As we mentioned other times in this blog, perpetual check
detection is one of Leela's weaknesses, but on the 2 previous times in this
tournament this had happened the position was draw so Leela did not lose any
points out of them. But in this game this may not be the case since while the
position was equal, a different choice by Leela not falling into the trap,
would mean the game will continue and who knows if Leela could turn the
position in her favor.

**ROUND 31**  
While Shredder started the tournament with 9.5 points after 11 games with 8
wins, 3 draws and no losses, in the next 20 games it has 11 points out of 20
games with 3 wins 1 loss and 16 draws!! It has been transformed into a drawing
machine. Here didn't manage to win against Nemorino.

Leela had a big fight as she had with black to face Stockfish. Stockfish with
white had 2 draws and 13 wins so far, no losses of course so Leela
theoretically before the match would have one of the toughest games. Yet Leela
playing a kind of anti-computer game managed to lock the position in a
Sicilian opening and after that an never ending shuffling occurred that was
more or less pointless as the result was determined already. A draw! In the
end there were some nice fireworks for the uninitiated eye of humans, but
these computers play on another level and both sides had everything under
control.

Houdini and Komodo outplayed in the endgame Xiphos and Vajolet respectively
and they won, so after Stockfish's draw both big 3 are tied in points for the
first place.

list the real result should be counted, as the CCCC result by their rules
because Gull crashed, was 1-0 in favor of Lc0.
