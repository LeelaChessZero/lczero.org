1st stage is almost over, 1 round remains but the top 8 engines that will
participate in stage 2 are known.  
 **Stockfish, Komodo, Houdini, Leela, Fire, Ethereal, Andscacs and Boot**
promote to next round.  
Next round, unlike this round, would be without pondering and every engines
will play every other 10 times so we would have a total of 70 games per
engine.

Andscacs won Arasan in the final round so Shredder has no hope to promote.

 **ROUND 43**  
In this round Leela destroyed Shredder's hopes for promotion by winning him
after a superb game where it completely outplayed Shredder with a startling
exchange sacrifice that Shredder(as also other engines like the mighty
Stockfish) had no idea about it. The defense that would lead to draw was very
thin and Shredder didn't manage to find it. To him as also to other engines
most moves drew easily. But that was not the case as the genius Leela knew in
this game!

505 Andscacs vs Ethereal 1/2-1/2  
506 Fire vs Crafty 1-0  
507 Booot vs Fizbo 1-0  
508 Fritz vs Arasan 1/2-1/2  
509 Xiphos vs Gull 1/2-1/2  
510 Houdini vs Wasp 1-0  
511 Vajolet vs Ivanhoe 1-0  
512 Komodo vs Texel 1-0  
513 Stockfish vs Laser 1/2-1/2  
514 Lco vs Shredder 1-0  
515 Senpai vs Nemorino 1/2-1/2  
516 Nirvana vs Pedone 1/2-1/2

superior to all other engines, Stockfish included, that in some positions
shine so much, like here. She knows this must be winning. But it's not :) The
drawing line though, is very hard to find and one has to dig incredibly deep
to dismiss countless other moves that seem to hold but in fact are losing for
just one tempo most of the times. But there is a line that seems to lead to a
draw. But judging for over the board play, in real game time play, the move
deserves 2 exclamation marks for creating a situation impossible not just for
Shredder, but for most engines or humans to handle over the board since white
is winning in most variations creating startling zugzwang situations. Yet the
real result must be drawn.} Rxc5 25. h5 $1 { Shredder thought he is better

**ROUND 44**  
Komodo won against Shredder making things worse for its promotion chances.  
While Leela in a complicated game with semi closed position and many pieces on
the board, outplayed Pedone as it was expected and reached a winning position.
Yet she blundered throwing away the win with 63...Bxd5?  
But once again afterwards analysis showed that if Leela was using its Lc0
binary of now, that is with support for endgame tablebases, it would avoid the
blunder in less than a second and would win.

Here follows the analysis of the position with Lc0 11089 net but with 3,4,5,6
syzygy TBs where we can see Leela avoids the drawing move in 1 second.  
In the game analysis below we can see and the test game of this Leela against
Stockfish where it wins easily when she uses tablebases.

So now along with the game against again Pedone with Leela having white, the
game Leela-Komodo and the current game, Leela has lost 1.5 points that if she
were using tablebases she would have won them.  
She also drew a won game against Crafty because of a blunder but Leela with
TBs would not have found. So 2 points thrown because off bad endgame play.

**ROUND 45**  
Leela won an easy game against Nemorino that didn't provide any resistance.  
Shredder had its 3rd loss in the last 3 games and didn't manage to welcome the
gift of Booot that won against Andscacs, so its hopes for promotion are based
on Arasan to draw the game with Andscacs.

Booot is the pleasant surprise of this tournament so far since no one believed
it has chances to promote!
