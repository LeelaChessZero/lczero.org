As you know, we are releasing Lc0 v0.17.0 to participate in the next CCCC
(chess.com computer chess competition) season, which will be the first season
with a new updated design.  
This version has support of pondering and partial support of engdames
tablebases, which are going to be useful for CCCC.

The CCCC team kindly agreed to run a testing gauntlet between Lc0 and bunch of
other chess engines before the main event.

This gauntlet is **LIVE** right **now**!

Enjoy!
