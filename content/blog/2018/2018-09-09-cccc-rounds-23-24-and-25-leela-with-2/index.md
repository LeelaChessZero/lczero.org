**ROUND 23**  
Andscacs won Arasan in an important win for top8 place, while Ethereal and
Booot drew their games.  
Top 3 continued with wins but Shredder drew.  
Leela took advantage of it and won against Laser so she is now alone in 4th
place. Leela's game was great, since while in the opening the game seemed dry
with no much play but Leela dominated with clever Pawn moves and showing great
long term understanding of the position it created a positionaly winning
position.  
Fizbo after 9 consecutive draws (17th in the tournament so far) it couldn't
hold and lost against the mighty Stockfish.

**ROUND 24**  
A small upset as Laser drew Komodo with black so Komodo lost some ground for
the hunt of 1st place.  
Fire and Shredder had a draw while Booot and Andscacs drew their games.  
Ethereal lost to Stockfish so it's not fighting for top 8.  
Leela won another game this time against Ivanhoe.

**ROUND 25**  
Laser after drawing Komodo in previous round, now it had a draw against
Houdini!  
Boot also had an easy draw against Stockfish.  
Fizbo, the drawmaster, with 18 draws out of 24 games was winning against
Nirvana, but maybe deliberately, not to miss its beloved draw result,
blundered and played wrongly and instead drew so now it has 19 draws out of 25
games!!

Leela with black against Gull had a draw too in a very dubious fashion, since
instead of playing for a win it followed the plan of exchanging everything and
up to move 25 the position was a dead draw. Worth noting is that while the
time controls is 15 minutes base time plus 5 second per move increment, Leela
on her 30th move had 15 minutes on her clock! While Laser had about 5.5
minutes. Meaning Leela blitzed the game playing essentialy on increment,
around 5 seconds per move for her first 30 moves! This is not of course and
the best way to handle time. Let alone her strategy of exchanging every
possible piece just to achieve equality. Since most of these engines are much
weaker than Leela she instead should seek keeping the Pawns and pieces on the
board and creating complicated positions. So she needs a kind of contempt like
the one traditional engines have especially the strongest ones like Stockfish,
that contempt implementation as default transformed its performance in
tournaments like TCEC winning much more frequently instead of just drawing.
