**Leela** in a classic drama style, **promoted in TCEC Cup Semi-Finals** and
it will face **Stockfish** today!  
While in **CCCC blitz** tournament she is still at **3rd place** ahead of
Komodo, Ethereal and Fire and behind Stockfish and Houdini.

**Leela** after a hard promotion against **Laser** with 6 draws in the first 6
games winning the last 2 and promoting, she faced **Ethereal** in a very tough
battle.

After a draw, she won the 2nd game and after 2 more draws she was leading
2.5-1.5 controlling the match. After a dubious predefined opening selection
that was choose, the Elephant gambit, Leela missed a tactic that Ethereal
found, a nice Bishop sacrifice 19.Bxf7! and after that it went downhill for
Leela. But Leela didn't win the reverse of the Elephant Gambit with her having
white pieces, so the series was again equal 3-3. Next 2 games were draws so
they went to tiebreaks with a score 4-4 of course. So they would have to play
1 pair of games till one side has a better score in this set of 2-games.  
First 2 sets were all drawn so score was 6-6. In the next set first game was
draw but in the 2nd game, the 14th in total of the series, with Leela white,
Leela managed to create a winning position that she should have won and end
the series promoting to next round. But she fell into one of her worst
enemies, a perpetual check! So she lost the chance.

With match tied at 7-7 next game ended in a draw but in the next game, 16th of
the series, only in 6th move Leela offered a Pawn in the opening that was
proved to be a poisonous one. Ethereal made the mistake to grab it and never
managed to recover since then. **Leela promoted with an 8.5-7.5 score.** You
can see this game analyzed here by Tryfon Gavriel (2121 CM) the known
Kingscrusher in youtube:

After promoting to Quarter-Finals Leela had to face a very strong opponent
again, the previously (since now probably this place belongs to herself as
most results show) number 4 engine in the world, **Fire**.  
After a very good start with 2 wins for Leela (the one with black pieces in an
English opening outplayed Fire creating a dangerous Kingside attack that took
advantage of it and won, while the next one in a Grunfeld that she played a
wonderful game reaching a late middlegame opposite colors Bishop position
where she squeezed Fire almost making it not having any moves to play) and a
draw in the first 3 games, many people believed this may be easy for Leela.
And in the 4th game another Grunfeld defense, the position that was reached
was a classic draw in engine Chess games, but Leela played doing some very bad
moves so she easily lost. After the next 2 games being a draw score was
3.5-2.5 in favor of Leela so with only 2 games remaining everyone believed
this might be over since with just 2 draws and of course if would win one
game, Leela would promote. In the 7th game a draw happened so Leela was too
close to promotion, she just had to hold the 8th game. But Fire played very
strongly creating pressure and trying things and while Leela tried to play
aggressively and not passive, she didn't manage to cope with Fire's powerful
play so she lost.

 **With the score tied at 4-4** a series of 2-game sets would start with a
promotion to the first engine that would win any set. Set 1 was a tie with
both engines drawing both games with black and with white. 2nd set of games
11-12 was again with 2 draws. But now without drama. In the first game another
Grunfeld resulted from the predefined opening selection for the engines. TCEC
gives a 4 ply predefined position to the engines to play and what was given
here was different from games 3-4, but resulted in a transposition of the
initial moves of these game since Leela and Fire seem to like Grunfeld and
while Leela won that game 3 with white she didn't manage to do it here in the
tiebreaks. And here was the problem. In reverse game with black pieces Leela
lost(game 4). So if she would lose here she would be eliminated. Game started
and indeed both engines followed game 4 (Fire-Leela 1-0) continuation so if no
one deviated Leela would lose an identical game! But Fire instead of playing
12.Rb1 that played in game 4 and won, deviated with 12.Ra1. And Leela defended
well and drew this one.

But in 3rd set of tiebreaks, in an again dubious predefined opening
choice(that engines would have of course to play it with both white and black
pieces) that gave white a clear edge, Leela played a wonderful game that won,
after having an opposite color Bishop late middlegame again, that resulted in
a very cramped black position that Leela masterfully handled and won easily.
But the reversed would of course be hard for Leela also, as that opening was
favoring white. Fire indeed started to take advantage of this creating a
better position for white but Leela played very cleverly giving 2 Pawns for
gaining an attack to the opponent King. The plan worked and the attack would
be too much for Fire to handle so position should be about equal had Leela
found 24...Bh4!! but she didn't and then she easily lost, since Fire played
amazingly an impossible to handle endgame for humans.

 **Now score was 7-7** and next 2 sets were a little quiet resulting in 4
draws even though in one of them Leela pressured hard for a win but didn't
make it. So with the score tied on 9-9 they reached the 19th-20th games. The
predefined opening was one similar to 4 Knights game but without e4 e5, where
Leela outplaying Fire once again reached a winning position. Stockfish
development version with 88 cores that was kibitzing the game saw a tactical
shot(27.dxe5!) that would win immediately but Leela didn't find it. Leela
still having a much better position seemed planless of how to exploit her
advantage but Fire was greedy capturing a Pawn so after that mistake never
recovered and Leela won easily. So she was leading with a **10-9** so she
again had a chance to promote if she would hold the next game.  
But she did even more by winning the next game so she promoted to next round!
That game was excellent also, as Leela giving all the space to Fire on the
Queenside, has created a powerful Kingside attack position where even
Stockfish that was kibitzing didn't notice. Fire on the other hand was
literally sleeping the whole game(and this was not the first time this
happened in the series), even thinking it was equal or even better when
Stockfish and Leela was showing -4.0 or less evaluations!

**this was before Laser-Leela game was replayed. In the initial game Leela
would have won as she had a totally winning position and
server/connection/remote hardware of Leela or whatever of Chess.com went down.
A replay of the game have been made some hours later after CCCC page fixed and
it was a draw. Depending on Chess.com' decision(probably they will adjudicate
as per their results the game as Leela win) the standings will be corrected.
