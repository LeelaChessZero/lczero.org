It turned out that the version v0.18.0, that was released a few days ago, had
a bug that caused it to miss tablebase wins sometimes.  
  
Because of that, v0.18.1 is released. You can download it
[here](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/releases/tag/v0.18.1).  
  
If you don't use tablebases, there is no need to update, v0.18.0 is fine.  
Also version v0.18.1 is **not** necessary for training game contribution,
version 0.18.0 is totally fine for that too.  
  
CCCC season 2 will use v0.18.1.  
TCEC cup uses v0.18.0 (probably).
