Leela had its first loss in the tournament after 27 games that went
undefeated. It lost against Ethereal with black after she blundered in
endgame.  
But before that, a real circus game happened in the Leela game of course
again. It was the Leela-Fisbo game with Fizbo the known drawmaster with 19
draws out of 25 games but Leela managed to hypnotize Fizbo to lose, while
Fizbo was playing with tablebases and the position was a drawn with just 4
pieces remaining!

 **ROUND 26**  
In this round Arasan upset Shredder by drawing him, while the big 3 won their
games as usual and Fire won against Nemorino. While for the battle of the top
8 place Booot, Ethereal and Andscacs won their games, even though all had the
black pieces.

The real craziness happened in the Leela-Fisbo game. Fizbo till now is drawing
most of its games with 19 draws out of 25 games and 9 draws out of the last
10!  
But here with Leela had no hope since Leela outplayed it and reached a won
position. But Leela playing with no endgame tablebases failed to find on
several occasions the winning move. Afterwards analysis has shown that Leela
with tablebases would have found most of the winning moves so she would have
won. Leela was pushing to win, the position was always won for her but she
didn't make any progress. When simplifications occurred she had to find in 2-3
occasions some easy winning moves (that most of them she finds with TBs) but
was still missing the key move that would give the final blow.

And suddenly she blundered! The position form then on was a dead tablebase
draw! And Fisbo was using tablebases and immediately has shown 0.00 indicating
of course that it would draw. The game as per rules of CCCC, continued till
the inevitable 50 move rule or stalemate draw and seemingly LEela would miss
half a point that she deserved for the way she played and outplayed the
opponent.  
But then suddenly Fisbo went crazy and played an unbelievable blunder and gave
away the game!! Unbelievable blunder for an engine that has access to endgame
3,4,5 and piece tablebases and we had 4 pieces on the board. Obviously some
bug of Fizbo that was exposed with the most dramatic way.  
Fizbo the drawmaster, threw away a dead, 4-men TB position, draw! Only Leela
can do this. Skynet maybe more close than we think.

The bug is reproducible as the following picture shows. Fizbo 1.9 with 3,4,5,6
syzygy tablebases, incorrectly, believes 209...Re1?? draws. 209...Rd2+ is the
move that draws.

plies) rule first. If the position started here and there was a capture let's
say 10 moves before, then the 50 move counter will be on 20 plies and Rb2
would be a huge mistake since white has a way to force checkmate by not taking
the Rook of course. With Kc3 or Kd3 that win by force. Here the desperado Rook
giving checks all the time and being immune from being captured doesn't work.

more heavily due to a bug and Leela finally won. All in all i think it was a
deserved win for the way Leela played in opening and middlegame. She has
issues in the endgame though, yet not in the extend they seem to be in CCCC
since there she does not use tablebases while Leela supports them and in this
game they would lead to an easy win.} 1-0

Here a little experiment to see how Leela with endgame tablebases would do
against SF dev(040918).  
SF dev had black pieces and 3,4,5,6, a big part of 7 TBs, while Leela 11089
net with 3,4,5,6 TBs running on 1 million nodes per move(around that much that
has on CCCC) and getting around 50000 to 120000 TB hits per move, played with
white pieces from 75.Qxc3 position.  
Leela got a comfortable win.

**ROUND 27**

In the battle for the 8 places, Booot, Ethereal and Andscacs won their games
again.  
Ethereal won against Leela in a sharp Sicilian because of a blunder of Leela
in the endgame. This was Leela's first loss in this tournament and now only
the first 3 are undefeated.

Shredder drew again and nothing reminds its early days in this tournament
where he was winning and winning and leading the tournament.
