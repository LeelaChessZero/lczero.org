Chess is a game where there are 3 distinct results. White wins or black wins
or it is a draw and nobody wins. Draw can achieved in many ways in Chess.
These are:

 **•Stalemate position.** A position where the player to move does not have a
legal move to play and his King is not in check. Game immediately ends as a
draw.

 **•3 times repetition** of a position(not necessarily in consecutive moves).
3 times repetition of a position is defined as when the **same position occurs
3 times**. **Same position** means that 2 positions are considered the same if
and only if the same player has the move AND pieces of the same kind and color
occupy the same squares AND the possible moves of the side to move are the
same AND the side to move as also the side not to move to have the same
castling rights BUT ONLY taking account for castling rights, whether the King
or the Rook, that the castling rights corresponds, has moved or not.  
If this threefold repetition happens, then the side to move can offer a draw
claim that has to be accepted and game ends as a draw. But when the position
is reached 3 times it's not an automatic draw. This means this rule, the so
called 3-fold repetition, is not a mandatory draw and game can continue if
player on move does not want a draw. Technically if both sides have just
repeated a position 3 times or the side to move can play a move that would
repeat 3 times the same position, the player having the move can claim a draw.

• **5 times repetition** of a position(not necessarily in consecutive moves).
FIDE has recently added this and with the same definition of repetition of a
position 3 times. But this 5-fold repetition is a forced draw. So if this
situation occurs a draw is forced.

 **•50 moves rule.** 50 moves rule is defined when the last 50 moves by **each
player** have been completed without the movement of any Pawn and without any
capture of a piece or Pawn.  
If this happens then the side to move can offer a draw claim that has to be
accepted and game ends as a draw. But when this happens and such game occurs
it's not an automatic draw. This means the 50 moves rule, is also not a
mandatory draw and game can continue if player on move does not want a draw.
Technically if both sides have just reached a position without the movement of
any Pawn and without any capture of a piece or Pawn in the last 50 moves by
each side, or the player having the move can play a move that will result in
the last 50 moves by each player having been made without the movement of any
Pawn and without any capture, then the player having the move can claim a
draw.  
**Checkmate** has higher precedence than 50 moves rule, so if the last move is
one, that a side can claim a draw by 50 moves rule, but it's also a checkmate,
then game is not drawn and a win for the side with the checkmate is rewarded.

 **•75 moves rule.** 75 moves rules is defined as any series of at least 75
moves that have been made by each player without the movement of any Pawn and
without any capture. If this happens, it's an automatic draw.  
If the last move resulted in **checkmate** , that shall take precedence and
game is won for the player that gave the checkmate.

 **•Dead position.** The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which
neither player can checkmate the opponent’s king with any series of legal
moves. The game **immediately ends in a draw.**

In engine play, engines can't claim a draw for 3-fold or 50 move rule, so it's
an old "agreement"  
that when 3 fold occurs or 50 move rule is reached game is an automatic draw!  
So 5-fold repetition or 75 move rule are useless for engine-engine games. Even
though having in engine-engine games the 50 or 75 move rule applied in the era
of 6 and 7 men endgame tablebases kills many wonderful checkmates in 80 and
100 and 200 or even 1000 moves.

 **E.g in the following position** white can force a checkmate in 550(or maybe
less) with a nice combination. But in between **violates the 50 moves rule so
this is a draw.** The whole magic of the combination is lost because of 50
moves rule that has been applied to save spectators(and players) from very
lengthy and unnecessary long games.  
But for engine games perhaps this should not apply. Of course then as engines
are never get tired and with the weakness of engines to endlessly shuffle many
drawn endgame positions, it would mean much longer games.

capture a piece instead of 50 that has available for not breaking 50 moves

_**3-fold repetition**_ is also interesting in some cases.  
For example in the _**position-1:**_  
White to move and black **King and Rook haven't moved** the whole game.

Black has castling rights as his King and Rook haven't moved.  
But black can't castle, since white b4 Bishop controls the f8 square the King
should pass to make the castle.

While after forcing to position-1 the moves 20.Ba5 Kf8 21.Bb4 Ke8, we reach
the _**position-2**_ :  
White to move and **black King has moved** obviously(20...Kf8 21...Ke8)

Similar looking with position-1, BUT here black can't castle because white b4
Bishop controls the f8 square _**AND**_ because King has moved.

These 2 positions are **NOT** the same regarding the 3-fold repetition
definition, since now black has lost castle rights because his King moved(and
this is the critical for whether the 2 positions are equal for 3-fold
repetition because of castling rights, if the Rook and King had moved or not).  
So in a case of a 3-fold repeat of a position, when for example, position 1 is
repeated 2 times and then position 2 arises again, it will be NOT a 3 fold
repetition and one could not claim a draw!

Now, about the above last rule for draws, _**the one with the dead position**_
, has a significant possible effect in time controlled games. As if a dead
position occurs, it is immediately being declared by Chess rules, as a draw
even if one side runs out of time. Of course in human play if the weak side
loses on time in such a position and haven't noticed it's a dead position(nor
its opponent-assuming a fair opponent that would tell) and the dead position
goes unnoticed it will be not declared as a draw provided the weak side loses.  
But in engine-engine games the GUI and most importantly the operator should
notice such things.  
While this issue and rule seems trivial and such positions trivial and easy to
look, there are many interesting dead (draw) positions.

Obviously the trivial dead positions are King-King, King-King+Knight, King-
King+Bishop.
