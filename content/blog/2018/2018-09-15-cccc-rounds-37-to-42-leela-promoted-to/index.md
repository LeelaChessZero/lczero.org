CCCC continues and **Leela** , along with **Stockfish** , **Houdini** ,
**Komodo** and **Fire** , already has secured a place in the 2nd stage.  
Ethereal after a strong finish, mainly winning in the last games, has almost
secured the promotion. Booot has also many chances.  
While Shredder and Andscacs are the ones that are competing for the final 8th
place right now with Shredder to be ahead, but having difficult opponents to
face in the next 4 rounds.

 **ROUND 37**  
Leela won a fine game against Fritz with an opposite colors Bishops ending
with Rooks also. Leela outplayed Fritz that made some mistakes being short on
time since it played in the beginning very slowly.

**ROUND 38**  
Fire in a sharp Sicilian Najdorf line, managed to win after a blunder of
Leela. If Leela would have found the correct move she would have drawn the
game. This CCCC net that is playing, i.e 11089, has tough time to find the
correct move and it sticks to the blunder after even more nodes examined than
it did in the game. But thankfully most newest nets of Leela find the correct
move instantly and stick with it. Out of 20 nets of test10 that have been
tried only 3 play the losing move and the other 17 play the correct move
easily as also the correct continuation. So it was just a bit of bad luck for
Leela. She is not perfect anyway. :)  
And of course this "she" is a bit ambiguous since there are so many nets of
Leela and most are untested, so no one really knows which is the strongest.
For sure though, the 11089 that is participating in CCCC, is not the strongest
as the nets after 11150 are surely stronger.

Ethereal had its 2nd win on the row and now things do seem better for his
chances to promote. While Shredder had a shock loss from Xiphos and now
struggles with the promotion! Andscacs lost from Houdini and also is on a bad
situation about promotion.

approximately every 40 minutes and this went for around 1-1.5 months, and with
every new net to have new strengths and new weaknesses also, but with a trend

**ROUND 40**  
Leela with black won against Arasan in a beautiful game and Ethereal had its 4
win in the last 4 games and now it's the favorite to promote.  
Boot drew with Laser and so Andscacs too and both took advantage of Shredder's
loss to Stockfish.  
In that game Shredder showed how not to play French with white! And it was
against Stockfish that of course grabbed the chance and did not forgive
anything! No favors to Shredder from the leader. Shredder did have a really
bad game and completely lost track of the position and Stockfish won rather
easily.

**ROUND 41**  
Leela won another nice game against Wasp this time, again showing some signs
of not being able to provide the crushing move, the move that will win easily,
but still managed to get a comfortable win in a game of zugzwangs. A really
beautiful game played by Leela that won because it made her opponent to be in
a zugzwang a-la Nimzowitsch style!

While Ethereal is on a roll since it made its 5th win in the lats 5 games and
now it's seems improbable that will not promote. Boot won against Ivanhoe also
almost securing its place in the 2nd stage. Andscacs drew against Fizbo and
lost a big chance to take a valuable full point since Shredder won against
Senpai easily.

we praised Deep Blue's move (...h5!) in Kasparov's game discussing how much it
understands from positional play. Chess programs back then suffered from
really gluing their King Pawns in their initial position and after a castle
they would be extremely afraid to move them forwards 2 squares for starting an
attack. So years and years these kind of moves were good testpositions for the
90s programs. 21 years later these kind of moves do happen extremely more
frequently in computer Chess world. In Leela's games they happen almost in
every game! :) She really knows when and where to move her Pawns. She has a
deep understanding of the position and she is seeing now that this h-Pawn will
create a ton of problems for black so she has no hesitation to move it.} Qb6

**ROUND 42**  
Stockfish continues its rampage winning the last 8 games.  
Leela also won a very nice game with black outplaying positionaly Texel with
some very nice moves.  
Shredder won against Nirvana and Andscacs lost to Fire and now it's the
outsider for promotion even though Shredder has to play difficult opponents in
next 4 rounds.  
Booot and Ethereal got 2 draws but probably this would not cost them as they
will promote.
