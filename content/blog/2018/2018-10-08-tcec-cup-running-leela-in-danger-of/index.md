TCEC Cup continues and we already know 6 engines that have promoted to next
round.  
Leela right now has a big fight with Laser and after 4 games it is on 2-2 with
4 draws.

It would be a big surprise if Leela will not manage to promote but with just 8
games everything can happen. The peculiar strength adaption to the opponent of
Leela is well known anyway, this means it can hold Stockfish to very close
result but playing against much weaker engines she doesn't perform
accordingly.

 _ **UPDATE:**_ **** After 6 draws in the first 6 games, Leela won the last 2
games to promote in the next round. In the game with black pieces she slowly
outplayed Laser obtaining eventually a won position, while with white pieces,
in a reversed opening from previous game, she managed to easily win heavily
outplaying Laser in a French defense where Leela knew even sooner than Cfish(a
clone of Stockfish that can run with 7 piece tablebases somewhat better than
Stockfish) running on 88 cores, what is going on in the position!  
Some analysis of the games will follow.....
