We recently did the 2nd LR drop for T40, and usually this is when the net
approaches it's strongest point (gains after the final LR drop are very
small). External Elo tests show T40 is close to T30, and may have already
passed. We will know more in the following few weeks. But coincidentally we
found two major issues at the same time as the LR drop:

<!--more-->

[Negative gammas not handled
correctly.](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/pull/779) This was a bug in
the Lc0 NN code, but since most Nets do not have negative gammas we didn't
notice it. As a coincidence at the 2nd LR drop many nets started to have
negative gammas. When this happens, the Net becomes very erratic (-100 Elo or
worse), so our gating caught these and prevented further permanent damage to
T40 training. This was fixed and released in v0.21.0.

[Pawn promotion issues.](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/issues/784) T40
developed a blind spot when a pawn can either capture+promote, or ignore the
capture and promote normally straight ahead. In this case, it placed nearly
100% of Policy on the capture+promote move. This lead to many blunders where
Lc0 never considered the opponent would play the normal promotion move. The
problem is related to details of how Batch Normalization is done. Starting
from net 41546, we are using [Batch
Renormalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03275).

You may have heard this issue described as a problem with too large gammas.
There were tests done with regularization on gamma, but they were slow to fix
the capture promotion. Batch Normalization has 4 main parameters (gamma plus
mean, variance, and beta), and they all interact. So we tried Batch
Renormalization to improve all 4 of these parameters, and it quickly fixed the
pawn promotion problem. It's still early to know if we have a final solution
or if there are further changes are needed. A major drawback of using Batch
Renormalization (and one reason we didn't use it from the beginning) is it
comes with even more hyperparameters that require tuning, especially during
the early LR stages.
