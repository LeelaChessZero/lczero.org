title: Lc0 vs GM Adam Tukhaev on Lichess
---

Not everyone knows, but recently there was a match between Lc0 and GM Daniel
Naroditsky on Lichess.  
For those tho missed, here is [recording of this stream on
Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/352945657) and [Lichess Blog
entry](https://lichess.org/blog/XBsCBBMAACUA3CJi/gm-daniel-naroditsky-takes-
on-leela-chess-zero) about that event.

In two days, Leela is playing with another grandmaster, this time it's GM Adam
Tukhaev!

 **When:** Jan 6th 19:00 UTC ([see your local time
here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=GM+Adam+Tukhaev+
vs+Lc0+on+Lichess&iso=20190106T19)).  
 **Time control:** 3+2, with a mix of bullet at 1+1 and 1+0.  
 **Lichess** **handles:** [almostadams](https://lichess.org/@/almostadams) and
[LeelaChess](https://lichess.org/@/LeelaChess).

Leela will be running on a CPU (i5-6600K @ 4.1 GHz, without GPU) and will give
Adam piece odds. If Adam finds it too easy, Leela will play with equal pieces.
