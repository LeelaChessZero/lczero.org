Not everyone knows, but recently there was a match between Lc0 and GM Daniel
Naroditsky on Lichess.  
For those tho missed, here is [recording of this stream on
Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/352945657) and [Lichess Blog

In two days, Leela is playing with another grandmaster, this time it's GM Adam
Tukhaev!

vs+Lc0+on+Lichess&iso=20190106T19)).  
 **Time control:** 3+2, with a mix of bullet at 1+1 and 1+0.
