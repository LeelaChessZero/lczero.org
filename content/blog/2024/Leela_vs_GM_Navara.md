Our goals for the match are to:
1. let people know about our [odds bots](https://lczero.org/blog/2024/02/update-on-playing-with-piece-odds-against-lc0-on-lichess/#quality-of-life-update-direct-challenge-links-on-lichess) and that they are worthwhile opponents even for very strong players,
2. determine how much time a strong GM needs to have balanced chances at knight odds,
3. entertain the spectators with exciting and competitive games, and
4. find ways we might improve the bot's play in the future. 

For some context the most recent public knight odds matches were by Komodo against GM David Smerdon (April 2020) and Komodo Dragon against GM Ben Finegold (January 2022). The games were played at 15'+10" and both GMs won, Smerdon 5-1 and Finegold 4.5-1.5. Even though GM Navara is substantially stronger, we anticipate a competitive fight due to the faster time control and Leela's considerably stronger odds play.

#### About GM David Navara

#### LeelaKnightOdds configuration

The LeelaKnightOdds bot will be using a (very close to final) pre-release version of Lc0 v0.31.0, with the BT4 5.87M network. It will be running on windfishballad's 4&times;RTX4090 system and we'll use a node limit so at longer time controls, Leela will move a bit faster. The bot settings are not yet finalized, but currently we are running `Contempt` 200 at a `WDLCalibrationElo` of 3200, with a short book to provide variety.
