#### From Specific to General Odds: Expanding Network Capabilities
Recent advancements in odds games have revealed the potential of fine-tuned Lc0 networks. Currently, training consists of games where White always starts without a knight (b1 or g1), and Black is consistently the weaker side. During this process, the model learns to distinguish between the stronger and weaker sides, resulting in weaker play when it plays as Black. However, it's possible to enhance the network's performance in odds by swapping colors, allowing it to perform effectively even when playing as Black.

Recent tests have shown that despite being fine-tuned exclusively for knight odds, this network performs better than any other, using contempt, in various other odds scenarios. This suggests the potential for developing a general odds network, instead of multiple specialized ones.
