We're excited to announce a queen odds exhibition bullet match between Leela and chess streamer [CM David Maycock](https://ratings.fide.com/profile/5142547).

- Sunday November 17, 4-6pm UTC
- Match will be played on Lichess between the accounts [LeelaQueenOdds](<https://lichess.org/@/LeelaQueenOdds>) and [CM Respectful_Dave](https://lichess.org/@/Respectful_Dave).
- Leela is playing white, without a queen.
- 2 official rounds: first 10 games at 1'+1", then 10 games at adjusted time control depending on the first round's result. 
- Possible bonus round: arbitrary time control, potentially Leela playing black

Our goals for the match are to:
1. let people know about our [odds bots](https://lczero.org/blog/2024/02/update-on-playing-with-piece-odds-against-lc0-on-lichess/#quality-of-life-update-direct-challenge-links-on-lichess) and that they are worthwhile opponents even for very strong players,
2. demonstrate the improvements achieved by [dedicated piece odds networks]({{< relref "Fine-Tuning_Lc0_Network_for_Odds_Games.md" >}})
3. entertain the spectators with exciting and competitive games, and
4. find ways we might improve the bot's play in the future. 

The match will be streamed (and potentially live commentated) at Dave's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@RespectfulDave)
