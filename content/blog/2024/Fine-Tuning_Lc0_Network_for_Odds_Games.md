#### A New Era for Odds Games: Lc0's Impressive Adaptation
The development of strength in odds games in the last few months has been impressive, thanks to the fine-tuning of Lc0 networks for specific odds scenarios. Our focus has primarily been on knight odds, but we expect these specialized networks to extend to all four odds featured bot on Lichess: [LeelaKnightOdds](https://lichess.org/@/LeelaKnightOdds), [LeelaRookOdds](https://lichess.org/@/LeelaRookOdds), [LeelaQueenForKnight](https://lichess.org/@/LeelaQueenForKnight), and [LeelaQueenOdds](https://lichess.org/@/LeelaQueenOdds). In the early stages, this dedicated network is operating under the LeelaKnightOdds-dev* Lichess bot account, which quickly captured the attention of the chess community by demonstrating not only superior performance but also an engaging and spectacular playing style.

The effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated in a match against GM Aleksandr Lenderman, consisting of 18 games played at a time control of 15'+10", where the specialized network achieved an impressive score of +14, =2, -2, marking a historic milestone as no Grandmaster has ever been defeated in an official match under knight odds at this time control before.

These specialized networks are still under development and are not yet publicly available. As development continues, we are actively seeking strong Grandmasters to challenge the network at knight odds, pushing its limits and helping us better understand what constitutes a fair opponent.

_*Note: This account will not accept challenges starting October 31, 2024, as the new network has been integrated into the featured bot, [LeelaKnightOdds](https://lichess.org/@/LeelaKnightOdds)_
