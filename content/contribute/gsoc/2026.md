The Leela Chess Zero project is quite diverse and has several areas to contribute to:

`TODO: COMPLETE OR DELETE THE LIST BELOW`

* The core engine (C++) — includes search and other engine logic.
  * Neural network backends (CUDA, OpenCL, and other hardware) to evaluate
    neural networks efficiently.

## Develop Python bindings for the Lc0 backends and the search

* **Skills needed:** Python, C++
* **Difficulty:** Easy / 90 hours

The current Python bindings for Lc0 are quite rudimentary and outdated. In order
to make it easier for researchers and enthusiasts to experiment with Lc0, we
need to develop comprehensive Python bindings (using pybind11 or nanobind) for
the Lc0 backends and potentially search. It should be integrated with
`python-chess`.

## Reimplementation of `live.lczero.org`

* **Skills needed:** (vanilla) TypeScript, Python
* **Difficulty:** Medium / 175 hours

`live.lczero.org` is a [web site](https://lczero.org/blog/2024/11/wcc24-live/)
where the Leela Chess Zero team run the live annotation of important chess
events (e.g., World Chess Championship). The current version was implemented in
hurry in a few days. We'd like to have a more robust and feature-rich
reimplementation, which we target to use in WCC 2026.

Some of ideas that we had in mind (for example, showing move tendencies which
are to be extracted deep from the search tree) require also Lc0 engine changes
(C++) — in that case, difficulty is certainly Hard and duration is longer.

It's also possible to only implement the C++ part of the project.

## Update the Metal backend

`TODO FILL IT`

(what has to be done there?)

## Have a JavaScript/WebAssembly backend for Lc0

* **Skills needed:** C++, JavaScript, WebAssembly
* **Difficulty:** Medium / 175 hours

Having the ability to run Lc0 directly in the browser would allow many use
cases, potentially including integrating Lc0 into lichess.  
We had several almost working prototypes of WebAssembly backends for Lc0, but
none of them was ever productionazed.

## Develop and train a CPU-focused backend for Lc0

* **Skills needed:** C++, basic machine learning knowledge
* **Difficulty:** Medium / 175 hours

Do optimize the scalability of the search algorithm, we need a fast neural
network evaluation. Normally, to saturate the search, we need several high end
GPUs. However, if we had a very fast "mock" backend that would run on CPUs, we
could optimize the search on more modest hardware.

We have a few such "mock"
backends ("random" and "trivial"), but they produce unrealistic evaluation and
search results in non-representative tree shapes.

The idea is to implement a CPU-focused backend that would be fast and have
reasonable strength.

## "Remote" backend

* **Skills needed:** C++, Network programming
* **Difficulty:** Hard / 175 hours

...

## `TODO: DELETE THIS` Unexpanded list

* Python bindings for search and neural network
* Rewrite live.lczero.org
* live.lczero.org — new backend ideas
* Update of the Metal backend
* Have proper Javascript backend
* CPU-targeted backend (e.g. Stockfish or Monty or train own)
* Implementation of "remote" backend
* Porting backends to new API (certainly not fun)
* Extend UCI output with json-based detailed state information
* Update XLA backend by switching to use StableHLO and writing MLIR bytecode writer
* Support for Ceres network files
* Something with JAX training pipeline (TBD)
* Something with experimenting with NN design (TBD); needs NN knowledge and GPU
* Training script cleanup (small tasks, like not requiring to to restart the script when config changes, TUI improvements etc)
* Extending UCI protocol with jsonl-like messages, and plugging them to something useful
* Client as windows screensaver — unlikely to be relevant
* Fix client / server to have more reliable game matches
* Tasks spawned by lc3 (e.g. external node storage; optimizations etc)
* Move certain parts of Lc0 to a separate repository with more relaxed license
* Implement chess variant? (duck chess?)
* Implement some tool (set of colab scripts) to explore Lc0 activations etc
* "Your idea here."
