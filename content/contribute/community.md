The LCZero project has an active community which follow development and competitions.

Join us at the following places:

## Discord

Our main place where most of discussions regarding development and other activity happen is 
our discord server. Join us using this invite link:

https://discord.gg/pKujYxD (also known as [lc0.org/chat](https://lc0.org/chat)).

Notable channels:
* **#help** -- ask in this channel if you have problems building, configuring or running Lc0.
* **#dev-public** -- developers talk here.
* **#dev** -- low-volume channel where only contributors can post. Intended for discussions
that should not be missed.
* **#dev-log** -- changelog and important-ish notifications go there. Also votes.
* **#test-results** -- post your test results there (there is a strict format to follow).
* **#test-discuss** -- discuss testing here.

## Forum
