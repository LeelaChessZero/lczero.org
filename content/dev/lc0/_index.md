`lc0.exe` is an
[UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface)-compatible chess
engine that uses neural networks to evaluate positions and select moves. Around
version v0.32, it underwent a refactoring which allowed it to support multiple
search algorithms, and support a wider range of backends.
