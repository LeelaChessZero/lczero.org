`lc3` is a new experimental search algorithm implementation currently in
development for Leela Chess Zero.

The design decisions are pretty much in flux, as of 2025-07-13. The initial
implementation contains number of speculative performance optimizations. The
idea is to undo optimizations later when we have a way to measure performance.
