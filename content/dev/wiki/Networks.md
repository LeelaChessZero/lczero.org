The networks below are our strongest available, and the first listed (BT4-spsa-1740) is what is currently being sent to engine competitions like the TCEC and CCC. In general, the largest network compatible with your hardware is recommended. To download, right click the corresponding link and select "Save link as..."

If you're getting `out of memory` errors when using large networks on GPU, you can tell the engine to process positions in smaller chunks by adding `--minibatch-size=16` to the lc0 command or config file. Alternatively, you can switch to a smaller network.

Note for DirectX12 and OpenCL backend users: The format of the networks in the list above is not supported. However, you can download and use the LC0 ONNX-DML version instead, see the included README file for instructions on how to get the directml.dll that can't be included in the package for licensing reasons, or use one of the legacy nets listed below.

### Legacy Nets

This section includes networks from older training runs. The strongest among these are [T78](http://training.lczero.org/get_network?sha=d0ed346c32fbcc9eb2f0bc7e957d188c8ae428ee3ef7291fd5aa045fc6ef4ded) and [T60](http://training.lczero.org/get_network?sha=7ca2381cfeac5c280f304e7027ffbea1b7d87474672e5d6fb16d5cd881640e04). Some download links might be outdated.

In each section, the nets are listed roughly in descending order of strength. Some may be too close to tell apart.
