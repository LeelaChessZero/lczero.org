### What is Lc0?

Lc0 (Leela Chess Zero) is a powerful, open-source chess engine that uses deep neural networks
and Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate chess positions. It was inspired by Googleâ€™s
AlphaZero and learns chess by playing millions of games against itself.

### Can I run Lc0 without a GPU?

Yes, Lc0 can run on CPUs, but it will be significantly slower than on a modern GPU.
There are specific CPU-only builds available (such as BLAS or DNNL). These builds are included in the [github releases](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/releases).

### Is stockfish or Lc0 stronger?

This will depend on specific hardware and testing conditions but generally stockfish is considered to be slightly stronger than Lc0.

### What is the best Lc0 network?

There is no one universally best network as that will depend on your hardware. You can find a list of best networks [here]({{<ref "bestnets">}})

### Where can I find the onnx-trt version of Lc0?

`onnx-trt` is an experimental backend for Lc0, it's not yet included in the
official releases. This is the version that played TCEC Cup 15. Note that it's
only beneficial for very high-end GPUs (i.e. RTX 5000/6000 series), and only for
bigger nets. Also note that the version that we compiled for TCEC doesn't have
other backends working (like `cuda`).

The binary can be taken from
[this build artifact](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/r0c84cm598j6tyfl/artifacts/build%2Flc0.exe).

You'll also need to download the `onnxruntime` from here
[Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/download/v1.22.0/onnxruntime-win-x64-gpu-1.22.0.zip)
or
[Linux](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/download/v1.22.0/onnxruntime-linux-x64-gpu-1.22.0.tgz).

Next, you need to download the [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt/download/10x) and 
[CuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn-downloads) DLLs, then add them to your PATH or the 
directory containing the lc0 binary.
