## About Human Sparring Networks

Human Sparring Networks are specially trained neural networks designed to play at human-like strength levels, making them ideal for:
- Practicing against opponents of specific skill levels
- Analyzing games from a human perspective
- Educational purposes and chess training
- Casual play without being overwhelming

These networks typically range from beginner to intermediate strength (approximately 1100-1900 Elo).

## Frequently Asked Questions
<!-- AI Generated -->
**Q: How do these compare to just limiting nodes on a strong network?**  
A: Human networks make more human-like mistakes and have more consistent playing styles compared to simply weakening a strong AI.
