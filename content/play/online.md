The easiest way to play Lc0 if you don't want to [install it on your computer]({{<ref "quickstart">}}) is to use one of **Lichess** bots. 
You can find them in the respective [lichess team](https://lichess.org/team/all-the-leelas). 
The ones that are almost always online are [Lc0Test](https://lichess.org/@/Lc0Test), [leela2200](https://lichess.org/@/leela2200) or [MiniHuman](https://lichess.org/@/MiniHuman). 
There is also an official Leela bot called [LeelaChess](https://lichess.org/@/LeelaChess), but most of the time it's offline.  
The [Maia](https://maiachess.com/) bots run on lc0 networks as well, you can play them on [lichess](https://lichess.org/player/bots).
